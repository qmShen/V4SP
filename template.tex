%% Uncomment one of the lines above depending on where your paper is
%% in the conference process. ``review'' and ``widereview'' are for review
%% submission, ``preprint'' is for pre-publication, and the final version
%% doesn't use a specific qualifier.

%% Please use one of the ``review'' options in combination with the
%% assigned online id (see below) ONLY if your paper uses a double blind
%% review process. Some conferences, like IEEE Vis and InfoVis, have NOT
%% in the past.

%% Please use the ``preprint''  option when producing a preprint version
%% for sharing your article on an open access repository

%% Please note that the use of figures other than the optional teaser is not permitted on the first page
%% of the journal version.  Figures should begin on the second page and be
%% in CMYK or Grey scale format, otherwise, colour shifting may occur
%% during the printing process.  Papers submitted with figures other than the optional teaser on the
%% first page will be refused. Also, the teaser figure should only have the
%% width of the abstract as the template enforces it.

%% These few lines make a distinction between latex and pdflatex calls and they
%% bring in essential packages for graphics and font handling.
%% Note that due to the \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{} call it is no longer necessary
%% to provide the the path and extension of a graphics file:
%% \includegraphics{diamondrule} is completely sufficient.

\section{Using the Style Template}
abcd

\section{Bibliography Instructions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Sort all bibliographic entries alphabetically but the last name of the first author. This \LaTeX/bib\TeX\ template takes care of this sorting automatically.
\item Merge multiple references into one; e.\,g., use \cite{Max:1995:OMF,Kitware:2003} (not \cite{Kitware:2003}\cite{Max:1995:OMF}). Within each set of multiple references, the references should be sorted in ascending order. This \LaTeX/bib\TeX\ template takes care of both the merging and the sorting automatically.
\item Verify all data obtained from digital libraries, even ACM's DL and IEEE Xplore  etc.\ are sometimes wrong or incomplete.
\item Do not trust bibliographic data from other services such as Mendeley.com, Google Scholar, or similar; these are even more likely to be incorrect or incomplete.
\item Articles in journal---items to include:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item author names
	\item title
	\item journal name
	\item year
	\item volume
	\item number
	\item month of publication as variable name (i.\,e., \{jan\} for January, etc.; month ranges using \{jan \#\{/\}\# feb\} or \{jan \#\{-{}-\}\# feb\})
  \end{itemize}
\item use journal names in proper style: correct: ``IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'', incorrect: ``Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions on''
\item Papers in proceedings---items to include:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item author names
	\item title
	\item abbreviated proceedings name: e.\,g., ``Proc.\textbackslash{} CONF\_ACRONYNM'' without the year; example: ``Proc.\textbackslash{} CHI'', ``Proc.\textbackslash{} 3DUI'', ``Proc.\textbackslash{} Eurographics'', ``Proc.\textbackslash{} EuroVis''
	\item year
	\item publisher
	\item town with country of publisher (the town can be abbreviated for well-known towns such as New York or Berlin)
  \end{itemize}
\item article/paper title convention: refrain from using curly brackets, except for acronyms/proper names/words following dashes/question marks etc.; example:
\begin{itemize}
	\item paper ``Marching Cubes: A High Resolution 3D Surface Construction Algorithm''
	\item should be entered as ``\{M\}arching \{C\}ubes: A High Resolution \{3D\} Surface Construction Algorithm'' or  ``\{M\}arching \{C\}ubes: A high resolution \{3D\} surface construction algorithm''
	\item will be typeset as ``Marching Cubes: A high resolution 3D surface construction algorithm''
\end{itemize}
\item for all entries
\begin{itemize}
	\item DOI can be entered in the DOI field as plain DOI number or as DOI url; alternative: a url in the URL field
	\item provide full page ranges AA-{}-BB
\end{itemize}
\item when citing references, do not use the reference as a sentence object; e.\,g., wrong: ``In \cite{Lorensen:1987:MCA} the authors describe \dots'', correct: ``Lorensen and Cline \cite{Lorensen:1987:MCA} describe \dots''
\end{itemize}
