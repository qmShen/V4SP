%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
Understanding the query execution process of distributed databases is crucial to many real-world practices such as detecting query bottlenecks and improving system performance. However, analyzing distributed query execution is challenging due to a large number of parallel tasks and the complex dependencies among these tasks. Moreover, system statuses such as network and memory can also affect query execution in complicated ways. Existing techniques typically collect \textit{aggregate statistics} of system performance (e.g., CPU, memory, and disk I/O) or execution progress (e.g., operator duration), and thus cannot track \textit{fine-grained query execution process} at the atomic task level, which is key to reason the query behavior. To tackle this problem, we propose $\DQV$, a visual analytics system that supports understanding and diagnosing distributed query execution from multiple views in an interactive manner. We tailor-make an algorithm for temporal directed acyclic graph (TDAG) layout to visualize the overall structure and execution process of the query plan. A suite of novel visualization and interaction designs are introduced to analyze the tasks, data dependency, and relation between atom task execution and system performance metrics. We illustrate the effectiveness of our $\DQV$ with three real-world case studies (i.e., query optimization, system configuration and xxx) and interviews with domain experts.

%Understanding the query execution of distributed databases is crucial to many real-world practices such as detecting the query bottleneck and improving the system performance.  Such analysis is always challenging due to the large volume of tasks executed in parallel and the complex task dependencies. Moreover, the unpredicted system behaviors also affect the query execution case by case. Existing techniques usually evaluate the distributed query by the statistics of system performance (e.g., CPU, memory, and disk I/O) or execution metrics(e.g., operator duration), which lost the fine-grained information at the atom task level. To tackle this problem, we propose $\DQV$, a visual analytics system to interactively understand and diagnose the distributed query execution procedure from multiple levels. An optimized algorithm for the temporal directed acyclic graph(TDAG) layout is devised to show the overall query plan structure and execution process. A suite of novel visualization and interaction designs are integrated to estimate the correlation between the atom task trace and the system performance metrics.  We illustrate the effectiveness of our $\DQV$ with three case studies from real-world applications and interviews with domain experts.
