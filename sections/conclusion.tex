\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose $\DQV$, an interactive visual system for Hive query execution analysis. 
$\DQV$ consists of three linked views which transfer the multi-level progress data into different visual forms according to the analyzing requirements, including:
1) a space-efficient algorithm to layout the TDAG, which displays the progress and the clear topology structure simultaneously; 
2) a novel visual encoding method to visualize the complex task dependencies and task distribution, system performance is also integrated with it to allow users to reason the query patterns; 
3) a task view for individual task analysis. Three case studies about the query execution understanding, resource bottleneck detection and query debugging as well as two user interviews show our system can be helpful in real-world practices.
